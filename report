Chosen model part1

- input: 224x224x3 image
- hidden layer 1: 512 neurons, relu activation, dropout 0.4
- hidden layer 2: 256 neurons, relu activation, dropout 0.4
- output: 3


Select a model with good performance by exploring a few hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate,
epochs, …) and model architectures (nb of neurons in the dense layer(s), use of dropout , …)
Document your results for a future report.

=>
We will use the following hyperparameters:
- learning rate: ?
- epochs: 25
- batch size: 32
- optimizer: rmsprop
- loss: sparse_categorical_crossentropy

Results:
- accuracy: ?
- loss: ?

We obtain good results with this model.
The confusion matrix shows that the model is able to predict the classes well, as there are no false positives or false negatives.
